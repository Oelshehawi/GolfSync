- COME UP WITH IMPLEMENATION FOR ANY PROMPT I SEND, AND EXPLAIN HOW YOU WILL IMPLEMENT, WHAT FILES WILL BE EDITED AND GET AGREEMENT FROM ME BEFORE ACTUALY EDITING OR CHANGING FILES
- I'm using NEXTJS as a framework
- use ui components in components folder whenever possible for styling
- all server side functions or functions that interact with server should check for organization id
- refer to [schema.ts](mdc:src/server/db/schema.ts) when doing anything with database to gain proper understanding of what needs to be updated
- always place databse functions in correct data.ts folder or actions.ts folder depending on what schemas being updated
- orgID should be fetches using @getOrganizationId FUNCTION thats already defeind in [auth.ts](mdc:src/lib/auth.ts) NOT await auth
- any function defined in a data.ts file canot be used in components marked with use client directive. only functions that are actions can, otherwise we must fetch in parent server compnent and pass down to client components.
